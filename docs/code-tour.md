## Weapons

Every weapon gets a three-character abbreviation (e.g. 870 or GMG), so that a fourth character can act as a suffix in sprite names.

The list of suffixes are:
- A for "ready" sprites.
- 1 for "primary" firing sprites.
- 2 for "secondary" firing sprites.
- 3 for any tertiary functions the weapon may have.
- S for raise/lower sprites.
- R for reload sprites.
- Z for "spawn" sprites and the inventory icon.
