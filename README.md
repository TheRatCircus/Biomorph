# Biomorph

Gameplay mod for GZDoom intended to introduce variety into player arsenals through randomness mixed with choices.

Inspired by [DoomRL Arsenal](https://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?f=43&t=37044), [LegenDoom](https://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?t=51035), [Custom Gun](https://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?f=43&t=54303), [Laevis](https://ancilla.ancilla.ca/share/j99gfv8-gAOLONXGJClBUeVNFBzFRjwKpQHLkm0r-88=/), and [Path of Exile](https://www.pathofexile.com/). 

Biomorph is early in development; expect its features and graphical/audio presentation to change rapidly.
