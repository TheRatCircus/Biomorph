# Biomorph

## About

Doom mod inspired by [Path of Exile](https://www.pathofexile.com/), [Torchlight 2](https://www.torchlight2.com/en), [DoomRL Arsenal](https://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?f=43&t=37044), and [Custom Gun](https://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?f=43&t=54303) about becoming increasingly powerful over successive levels. Balance not guaranteed.

Biomorph is early in development; expect its features and graphical/audio presentation to change rapidly.
