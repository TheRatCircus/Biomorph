# Biomorph

## About

Doom mod inspired by [Path of Exile](https://www.pathofexile.com/), [LegenDoom](https://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?t=51035), [DoomRL Arsenal](https://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?f=43&t=37044), and [Custom Gun](https://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?f=43&t=54303) about becoming increasingly powerful over successive levels. Balance not guaranteed.

Biomorph is early in development; expect its features and graphical/audio presentation to change rapidly.

A complete list of attributions and third-party licensing information can be found [here](/ATTRIB.md). Licensing information for this mod is [here](/LICENSE).

This mod depends upon a minimum ZScript version of 2.4, but assume it is tested on the 64-bit Ubuntu build of the latest version of GZDoom with default compatibility flags.
